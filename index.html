      Simon once asked a barsita at a hotel lobby, whether he liked his job.
      <br>
      Without batting an eye, the guy said that he loved his job. 
      On the other hand, the barista continued, he just counts the hours at another hotel where he also served up lattes.
      <br>
      <br>
      What was different? At the first place the leadership asked how he was doing and what he needed. 
      At the second, they watched to see when he would screw up.
      <br>
      In short, It's not the person, it's the environment! 
      <br>
      Leaders are responsible for creating an environment 
      where people feel safe, valued and inspired to work.

      Many leaders think that they are responsible for the results - that's wrong, leaders are 
      responsible for the people who are responsible for the results.

      <i>'Take care of your employees and they will take care of your business' - Sir Richard Branson</i>
      <br>
      <br>
      If employees are treated as 'just another resource' to serve the customer - they will 
      spend more time in protecting themselves from you than spending time in serving the customer.

      A must have for all leaders is 'Courage', because it's hard to:
      <ul>
        <li>- stand up against outside pressure.</li>
        <li>- stand up against an external constituency which is pushing you to do something
          for their own short term gain at the expense of your people's welfare.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      Courage comes from the support you feel from others. In other words, when you feel that someone
      has your back, you muster the courage to admit your mistakes, ask for help, and take risks to acheive something big.

          No one wakes up in the morning to go to work with the hope that someone will manage us. 
          We wake up in the morning and go to work with the hope that someone will lead us.

            Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) has successfully helped people beat the dopamine addiction of alcoholism. 
            Most of us have heard of their twelve-step program to recovery.
            <br>
            <br>
            Few if any of the alcoholics enrolled in AA will find sobreity until they complete Step Twelve. Even if they make it through the other eleven steps, 
            those who do not complete Step Twelve are very likely to drink again.
            <br>
            Step Twelve is the commitment to help another alcoholic beat the disease. Step Twelve is all about service. And it is the service that is the key to a healthy organization. 
            It's the service to our colleagues whom we work every day.

          'Loving the work we do' should be a right and not just a privilege. Leaders must create an environment where people love to work.
          <br>
          <br>
          Working for something that we don't care about is called stress. Working for something that we care about is called passion.
